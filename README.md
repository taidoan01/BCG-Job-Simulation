## Task 1: Business understanding and hypothesis testing

Your first task is to understand what is going on with the client and think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis, focusing on the data you would need from the client as well as the analytical models you would use to test the hypothesis.

## Task 2: Exploratory data analysis
The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data which includes:

- Historical customer data: customer data such as usage, sign-up date, forecasted usage
- Historical pricing data: fixed and variable pricing data
- Churn indicator: whether or not each customer has churned

## Task 3: Feature engineering and modelling

The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use the data to further understand the business problem. The team now needs to brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.

Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through mathematical modelling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those features to later use in your model.

Your colleague has done some work on engineering the features within the cleaned dataset and has calculated a feature that seems to have predictive power.

## Task 4: Findings and recommendations
The client wants a quick update on the progress of the project.
